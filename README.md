This repository contains code used for the IRTree 3-process model (3PM) parameter recovery study. The following conditions were evaluated:
  - Persons (750, 1500, 3000)
  - Items (10, 20)
  - Estimation (MCMC, MLE)
  - Intertrait correlations (low = +- 0.20, mod = +- 0.50)
  - Proportion of midpoint responses (low = 11%, mid = 20%, high = 38%)
